This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

Amazon Location Service lets you add location data and functionality to applications, which
includes capabilities such as maps, points of interest, geocoding, routing, geofences, and
tracking. Amazon Location provides location-based services (LBS) using high-quality data from
global, trusted providers Esri and HERE. With affordable data, tracking and geofencing
capabilities, and built-in metrics for health monitoring, you can build sophisticated
location-enabled applications.

## Place Index

A key function of Amazon Location Service is the ability to search the geolocation information.
Amazon Location provides this functionality via the Place index resource. The place index includes
which [data provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/what-is-data-provider.html)
to use for the search.

To create a place index, define a `PlaceIndex`:

```go
location.NewPlaceIndex(this, jsii.String("PlaceIndex"), &PlaceIndexProps{
	PlaceIndexName: jsii.String("MyPlaceIndex"),
	 // optional, defaults to a generated name
	DataSource: location.DataSource_HERE,
})
```

Use the `grant()` or `grantSearch()` method to grant the given identity permissions to perform actions
on the place index:

```go
var role role


placeIndex := location.NewPlaceIndex(this, jsii.String("PlaceIndex"))
placeIndex.grantSearch(role)
```
